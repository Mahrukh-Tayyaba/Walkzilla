## 🚀 Submission Process

### 1. Prepare Your Application
1. Build final app bundle with Health Connect integration
2. Test thoroughly on multiple devices
3. Ensure all permission flows work correctly
4. Verify real data is being fetched

### 2. Submit to Google
1. Go to [Health Connect API Access Form](https://developers.google.com/health-connect/api/access)
2. Fill out the application form
3. Upload your app bundle
4. Provide detailed description of how you use Health Connect
5. Include screenshots of your app's health features

### 3. Application Details to Include
- **App Name**: Walkzilla
- **Package Name**: com.mt.walkzilla
- **Health Data Types**: Steps, Active Calories, Distance

- [ ] App handles permission denial gracefully
- [ ] Fallback to simulated data works when Health Connect unavailable
- [ ] No crashes or errors in permission flow
- [ ] Data is properly formatted and displayed

### Test Scenarios:
1. **Fresh Install**: New user, no Health Connect permissions
2. **Permission Grant**: User grants all permissions
3. **Permission Denial**: User denies permissions
4. **Health Connect Unavailable**: Device without Health Connect
5. **Data Refresh**: App fetches updated data
6. **Error Handling**: Network issues, API errors
